The map shows where whales are most likely to be each day based on current environmental conditions, such as ocean temperature and productivity.\n\n\n\nHow do I use the WhaleWatch 2.0 Map?\n\nBetter blue whale habitat is indicated by increasingly red colors, showing where the likelihood of blue whale presence is higher. Poorer blue whale habitat is indicated by increasingly blue colors, showing where the likelihood of blue whale presence is lower. If blues whales are present in the area, the map indicates where they are most likely to be.\n\n\n\nHow is the WhaleWatch 2.0 Map product made?\n\nEach day the WhaleWatch 2.0 tool generates predictions of the spatial distributions of blue whales based on an ensemble of models predicting blue whale habitat suitability from current ocean conditions. For detailed methodology of model building, see the study published about the product. This is an update to the previous WhaleWatch effort that was at 25km resolution and updated monthly (URL).\n\n\n\nWhat environmental data are used?\n\nDaily ocean conditions such as sea surface temperature, locations of frontal zones, and water column properties are sourced from a near-real-time data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System for the California Current System.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Channel Islands Shipping Lane Indicator?\n\nThis indicator shows daily whale habitat suitability within the primary shipping approach north of the Channel islands and the southern undesignated approach in the Southern California Bight. This type of information allows managers to understand shipstrike risk exposure in shipping lanes within and among years as a function of environmental conditions, allowing for informed decision-making regarding vessel speed reductions.\n\n\n\nLocation of the shipping approaches."

    "text": "The mission of our project is to bring best-available science and analyses to support the ecological sustainability and economic viability for U.S. ocean users. With decades of experience in endangered species protection, marine resource management, and oceanographic and species distribution analyses, our research team is working to support the development of innovative management approaches that meet ecological and economic management objectives and mandates.\nBlue whales are an Endangered Species, with roughly 1500 whales estimated in the migratory Eastern North Pacific Population off of the U.S. West Coast. This population is threatened by ship strikes, which are the largest source of mortality, as well as bycatch in fishing gear. WhaleWatch 2.0 is a predictive spatial management tool that helps scientists and managers evaluate the most likely times and places that blue whales will be present along the U.S. West Coast in order to inform management decisions and mitigate risk of ship strikes, bycatch, or other threats. This is the latest dynamic model for blue whales. Previous models for blue whales in the California Current Ecosystem include the original WhaleWatch effort and a climatological ensemble model that provides a best seasonal estimate from multiple data sources and modeling approaches.\n\n\n\n\nFunding has been provided by:\n\nBenioff Ocean Initiative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal on Earth. Photo copyright: NOAA Fisheries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhaleWatch 2.0 is a consortium of scientists, managers, and members of the shipping industry, including:\n\nUC Santa Cruz\n\nOregon State University\nNOAA Environmental Resource Division\n\nThey work directly with resource managers, fishing industry, and other stakeholders."

    "text": "Dynamic Ocean Management\nDynamic ocean management is a new management approach that uses real-time and near real-time data to support management responses that can change in space and time, at scales relevant for animal movement and human use. Dynamic ocean management can use diverse analytical approaches (simple to complex), supports climate-resilient fisheries, and is already implemented in many oceans around the world.\n\nHow does it differ from traditional ocean management?\nTraditional Ocean Management\n\nBoundaries are fixed in space and time.\nStatic schemes must be large enough to capture broad-scale ocean processes.\nCan have high opportunity costs for fishers.\nRendered ineffective during anomalous events (e.g. species seasonal migrations or shifts of fishing fleets).\n\nDynamic Ocean Management\n\nBoundaries and recommendations can change in near real time.\nAlign management actions with the variability of ecosystems.\nIncorporates diverse data sources:\n\nSatellite data\nOcean monitoring arrays\nBio-geochemical models\nCrowd-sourced reports from ocean users\n\nProvides managers with recommendations that reflect current marine conditions.\n\n\n\nWhy it matters\nDynamic ocean management sits at the interface of science and management. It captures the best-available science and directs it to meet the needs of resource managers and the fishing industry.\nWhat’s exciting about this research:\n\nPuts science and data analytics to work in real time, and\nFundamentally changes how oceans are managed."
