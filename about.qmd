### Mission and Vision
The mission of our project is to bring best-available science and analyses to support the ecological sustainability and economic viability for U.S. ocean users. With decades of experience in endangered species protection, marine resource management, and oceanographic and species distribution analyses, our research team is working to support the development of innovative management approaches that meet ecological and economic management objectives and mandates.

Blue whales are an [Endangered Species](https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-endangered-species-act), with roughly 1500 whales estimated in the migratory Eastern North Pacific Population off of the U.S. West Coast. This population is threatened by ship strikes, which are the largest source of mortality, as well as bycatch in fishing gear. WhaleWatch 2.0 is a predictive spatial management tool that helps scientists and managers evaluate the most likely times and places that blue whales will be present along the U.S. West Coast in order to inform management decisions and mitigate risk of ship strikes, bycatch, or other threats. This is the latest dynamic model for blue whales. Previous models for blue whales in the California Current Ecosystem include the [original WhaleWatch effort](https://people.ucsc.edu/~elhazen/hazen/Publications_files/Hazen_et_al-2017-JAE.pdf) and a [climatological ensemble model](https://people.ucsc.edu/~elhazen/hazen/Publications_files/Woodman_et_al-2019-Methods_in_Ecology_and_Evolution.pdf) that provides a best seasonal estimate from [multiple data sources and modeling approaches](https://cetsound.noaa.gov/cda-index).

## Dynamic Ocean Management

Dynamic ocean management is a new management approach that uses real-time and near real-time data to support management responses that can change in space and time, at scales relevant for animal movement and human use. Dynamic ocean management can use diverse analytical approaches (simple to complex), supports climate-resilient fisheries, and is already implemented in many oceans around the world.


### How does it differ from traditional ocean management?

<span style="font-weight:bold" class="noaa-blue">Traditional Ocean Management</span>

- Boundaries are fixed in space and time.
- Static schemes must be large enough to capture broad-scale ocean processes.
- Can have high opportunity costs for fishers.
- Rendered ineffective during anomalous events (e.g. species seasonal migrations or shifts of fishing fleets).

<span style="font-weight:bold" class="noaa-blue">Dynamic Ocean Management</span>

- Boundaries and recommendations can change in near real time.
- Align management actions with the variability of ecosystems.
- Incorporates diverse data sources:
  - Satellite data
  - Ocean monitoring arrays
  - Bio-geochemical models
  - Crowd-sourced reports from ocean users
- Provides managers with recommendations that reflect current marine conditions.

### Why it matters

Dynamic ocean management sits at the interface of science and management. It captures the best-available science and directs it to meet the needs of resource managers and the fishing industry. 

<span style="font-weight:bold" class="noaa-blue">Whatâ€™s exciting about this research:</span>

- Puts science and data analytics to work in real time, and
- Fundamentally changes how oceans are managed.
